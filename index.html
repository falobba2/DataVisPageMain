<h1>How Coronavirus affected the world</h1>
  
<p>As of 31 December 2020, COVID-19 had infected over 82 million people and killed more than 1.8 million worldwide. But preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global “excess deaths” directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19 in 2020 amount to at least 3 million, 1.2 million higher than the official figures reported by countries to WHO.

With the latest COVID-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.3 million, based on the estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to COVID-19. -World Health Organization Spotlight, May 20,2021</p>

<p>This presentation will look into how coronavirus affected the world and dig deeper by looking at comparisons on each regions and each country.</p>
